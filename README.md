        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In this test, you'll be shown several series of letters and digits, such as H 2 E 4. 
           After being shown a series, you'll be asked to type in a text box all of the letters and digits that were shown, 
           but with the digits coming first, ordered from smallest to largest, and then the letters in alphabetical order. 
           In this case, you'd have to type 24EH. Remember: you must first type all of the digits and only then type the letters, 
           both in ascending order (1 before 9, A before Z)!</p>
